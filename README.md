# chMkzzRBvcoyh3mk: Happy Costumer project

#Task

We want to predict (accuracy score >=73%) if a customer is happy or not based on the answers they give to questions asked. This is a classification problem.

#Steps

*Explore data

*Select and build a model

*Evaluate the model

#Summary of the tech Stack: 

We identified a classification problem. Exploration of data indicates that data have no missings and are balanced.
Hyperparameters tunning and feature selection were applied to prevent overfiting and improve the accuracy.
THese treatments was applied to Random forest and Xgboost models. Finally we selected to random forest 
which predicts costumers happiness with a F1-score of 79% and 69% for the train and test accuracies, respectively.

#Tech stack

*code in jupyter notebook

*Python version 3.9.7
